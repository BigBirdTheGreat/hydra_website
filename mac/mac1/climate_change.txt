1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1 1/4 cups milk
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Instructions:

In a medium mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.
Add the milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract. Mix until the batter is smooth and well combined.
Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.
Use a 1/4 cup measuring cup to scoop the batter onto the griddle or pan. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook until the other side is golden brown.
Repeat with the remaining batter.
Optional: You can add your favorite toppings to the pancakes such as sliced bananas, berries, maple syrup, or whipped cream.
