Endless pursuit of wealth,
Money flows like a river,
Capitalism thrives.

Stock market rising,
Investors counting their cash,
Capitalism wins.

Consumer culture,
Buying and selling non-stop,
Capitalism reigns.

Greed drives the market,
Profit is the ultimate goal,
Capitalism rules.

Competition fierce,
Winners take all in this game,
Capitalism's law.
