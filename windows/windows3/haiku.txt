Congress in stalemate
Partisan politics reign
Nation waits for change

Election season
Fingers pointed left and right
Country torn in two

Corruption abounds
Bribery and backroom deals
Democracy wanes

Red states, blue states clash
Divided we fall apart
Let's unite as one

Taxes on the rise
Government spending unchecked
People's pockets drained

Red flags waving high,
The revolution takes root,
Workers unite now.

Land and factories,
Collectivized for the good,
Communism blooms bright.

Proletariat rise,
Break the chains of bourgeoisie,
Power to the masses.

Revolution's call,
Workers of the world unite,
Communism reigns.
